# Dnf2b

Because fail2ban does often fail to ban.

## Requirements

* A C++20 compiler
* A Linux server

## Current status

At this time, dnf2b is considered barely deployable, and barely functional. It has the bare minimum features required to function, but lacks many important features, and has a very thin ruleset. See also the Caveats section, which will be true even when features catch up and dnf2b becomes stable, and this notice disappears.

## Caveats

Due to this being a significantly less established project than f2b, it's lacking in filters. Other alternatives offer a better out-of-the-box experience. The primary goal of this project is to provide a more stable system, at least on systems I'm able to test.
