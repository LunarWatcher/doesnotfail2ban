# Dnf2b

Because f2b doesn't always do its job.

## Requirements

* A C++20 compiler

## Caveats

Due to this being a significantly less established project than f2b, it's lacking in filters. Other alternatives offer a better out-of-the-box experience. The primary goal of this project is to provide a more stable system, at least on systems I'm able to test.
